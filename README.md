# Hubstaff interview test

The idea is get the data from Hubstaff organization and show it in a datable.

Some decisions:
* As this is a small project, with just some basic requierements, I decide to use Flask instead of Django
* Again, because is a small project, I decide to not use a Database and get all the data from hubstaff in the start, this way I don't have to worry about sync the data between the DB and Hubstaff
* Again, bacause is a small project, I'm not using a package/environment manager as pyenv (Maybe I should)
